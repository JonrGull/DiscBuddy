# Welcome to DiscBuddy, a fun little bot that will try to brighten up your day.

##Created using Java and JDA[https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA].

# Configuration

Since I will not be able to keep this bot online 24/7, I have no problem with it being configured by other people. So please feel free to do so, but you need to add your own keys and tokens!

- This Bot uses NASA's API[https://api.nasa.gov/] and thecatapi.com[https://thecatapi.com/] to provide images of space and cats. Create a .env file in the root directory of the project and add the following lines:

```
DISCBUDDY_KEY=<your_key>
NASA_KEY=<your_key>
CAT_KEY=<your_key>

```

# Commands

The bot will respond to the following commands:

- !help - Displays all the commands the bot can respond to.
- !time - Displays the current time and date in the server.
- !space - Displays a random image of space.
- cat - The bot listens for the word 'cat' (and other similar words!) and responds with a random gif of a cat.
